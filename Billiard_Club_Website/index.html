            <h3 class="article-title">History of Billiard</h3>
            <p class="article-txt">The History of billiards is long and very rich. The game has been played by kings and
                commoners, presidents,
                mental patients, ladies, gentlemen, and hustlers alike. It evolved from a lawn game similar to the
                croquet
                played some-time during the 15th century in Northern Europe and probably in France. Play moved indoors
                to a
                wooden table with green cloth to simulate grass, and a simple border was placed around the edges. The
                balls
                were shoved, rather than struck, with wooden sticks called "maces." The term "billiard" is derived from
                French, either from the word "billart", one of the wooden sticks, or "bille", a ball.</p>
            <p class="article-txt">Most of our information about early billiards comes from accounts of playing by
                royalty and other nobles.
                It has been know as the "Noble Game of Billiards" since the early 1800’s but there is evidence that
                people from all walks of life played the game since its inception. In 1600, the game was familiar enough
                to the public that Shakespeare mentioned it in Antony and Cleopatra. Seventy-five years later, the first
                book of billiards rules remarked of England that there were few "few Tones of note therein which hath
                not a publick Billiard-Table."</p>
            <p class="article-txt">The cue stick was developed in the late 1600’s. When the ball lay near a rail, the
                mace was very
                inconvenient to use because of its large head. In such a case, the players would turn the mace around
                and use its handle to strike the ball. The handle was called a "queue" meaning "tail" from which we get
                the word "cue." For a long time only men were allowed to use the cue; women were forced to use the mace
                because it was felt they were more likely to rip the cloth with the shaper cue.</p>
            <p class="article-txt">Tables originally had flat walls for rails and their only function was to keep the
                balls from falling
                off. They resembled river banks and even used to be called "banks". Players discovered that balls could
                bounce off the rails and began deliberately aiming at them. Thus a "bank shot" is one in which a ball is
                made to rebound from a cushion as part of the shot.</p>
            <p class="article-txt">Billiard equipment improved rapidly in England after 1800, largely because of the
                Industrial Revolution.
                Chalk was used to increase friction between the ball and the cue stick even before cues had tips. The
                leather cue tip, with which a player can apply side-spin to the ball, was perfected by 1823. Visitors
                from England showed Americans how use spin, which explains why it is called "English" in the United
                States but nowhere else. (The British themselves refer to it as "side".) The two-piece cue arrived in
                1829. Slate became popular as a material for table beds around 1835. Goodyear discovered vulcanization
                of rubber in 1839 and by 1845 it was used to make billiard cushions. A two-to-one ratio of length to
                width became standard in the 18th century. Before then, there were no fixed table dimensions. By 1850,
                the billiard table had essentially evolved into its current form.</p>
            <p class="article-txt">The dominant billiard game in Britain from about 1770 until the 1920’s was English
                Billiards, played with
                three balls and six pockets on a large rectangular table. The British billiard tradition is carried on
                today primarily through the game of snooker, a complex and colorful game combining offensive and
                defensive aspects and played on the same equipment as English Billiards but with 22 balls instead of
                three. The British appetite for snooker is approached only by the American passion for baseball; it is
                possible to see a snooker competition every day in Britain.</p>
